# ImageScraper
The main reason for creating this was to get a better understanding of how a web scraper works and it's can prove very useful for getting large data-sets very quickly.

So what I've done is i've gone on NBA2K19MyTeam webpage to download images from there because these images are used for redeemable codes in the game.
While also I have seen the amazing results of what this handly little tool can do loading over 30 links off images from a single twitter page.
