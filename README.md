# ImageScraper
The main reason for creating this was to get a better understanding of how a web scraper works and it's can prove very useful for getting large data-sets very quickly. its also a huge reason why large companies do it not always for the most ethical reasons of course. Web scraping as a whole is considered a bit of a grey area due to bots being used to access huge chunks of data that really companies dont want being scraped.

So this small project was done for STRICTLY education purposes to see how the technology works on a very very small scale.


So what I've done is i've gone on NBA2K19 MyTeam twitter webpage to download image links from there because these images are used for redeemable codes in the game so scraping these code deemed useful at the time while also these are publicly accessable and are purposely placed on the page to be used.

While also I have seen the amazing results of what this handly little tool can do loading over 30 links of images from a single twitter page. it has shown me the true effect this tool could have to buisnesses so for example a business could use this to grab data on other companies to see what types of products are most popular to really boost chance of sales using statistical data. Or for un-ethical purposes a hacker could have a bot that uses this looking for vulnerabilities and if vital information was leaked the bot could scrape all the data.
